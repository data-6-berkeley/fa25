(new, [Fa25](https://classes.berkeley.edu/content/2025-fall-data-6-001-lec-001)) From the course catalog: This foundational Data Science course combines inferential and computational thinking as applied to the fundamentals of quantitative social inquiry. Apply critical concepts and skills in computer programming to conduct quantitative social science research in various contexts, including economic outcomes, public health, environmental justice, privacy, bioethics, and social networks. Understand the process of using data for quantitative analysis and how to develop a variety of figures, combined with text, to communicate their findings. The focus is on data exploration and identifying patterns relevant to social concepts, rather than inferences and predictions. The course can serve as a precursor to Data 8: Foundations of Data Science.

(old) From the course catalog: This course is an introduction to computational thinking and quantitative reasoning, designed to prepare students for further coursework in data science, computer science, and statistics (in particular, Foundations of Data Science, Data C8). This course emphasizes the use of computation to gain insight about quantitative problems with real data from the social sciences.

## Editing this website

Most of the docs are on [berkeley-class-site](https://berkeley-cdss.github.io/berkeley-class-site/).

Data 6 has been customized to use the `_data` folder for different YAML files. We don't have pages per lecture, etc.
